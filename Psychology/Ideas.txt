Ways To Solve Emotion & Psychology Problems:
1. use minimum level of position risk and raise it gradually after getting comfortable with conditions & results

2. you should have blief & confidence to final positive expectency, so only focus on process to making best decisions and don't focus on upcoming trade results

3. say "there is a long way go and a lot more trades should be executed along the way,so why should you care about these few trade results?", it is a logical decision and is not related to emotions and psychology
	say "these bad results are key parts of expectency and must happen in this process so let them shine"
