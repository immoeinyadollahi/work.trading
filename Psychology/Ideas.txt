Ways To Solve Emotion & Psychology Problems:
1. use minimum level of position risk and raise it gradually after getting comfortable with conditions & results
	take the trades with lower risks and go slow and steady until reaching to your desired goal

2. you should have blief & confidence to your edge and its final positive expectency, so only focus on process to making best decisions and don't focus on upcoming trade results

3. say "there is a long way go and a lot more trades should be executed along the way,so why should you care about these few trade results?", it is a logical decision and is not related to emotions and psychology
	say "these bad results are key parts of expectency and must happen in this process so let them shine"
	
4. don't say "profit or loss" instead say "green & red" and should focus on process so greens can dominate reds like a game





Practical Ways:
1. put your favourite posters about trading and psychology concepts or even notes on your room walls to remind yourself about current situation

2. use motivational posters or texts in your room
