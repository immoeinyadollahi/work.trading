1. use minimum level of position risk at start and raise it gradually after getting comfortable with conditions & results
	
2. take the trades with lower risks and go slow and steady until reaching to your desired goal
	increase your risk slowly & gradually as improving your trader skillset and getting more & more experience in the market and trading
	
3. only risk for an amount which you don't care about and losing that will not effect your psychology
   manage your risk because you anticipate the next trade will be loss

4. limit maximum risk to only 1%/0.5% so risk can be dynamic and changes based on current balance drawdown/growth

5. adjust the risk of your trades based on balance status
	for example: 
	if balance goes under drawdown to specific level use lower risk amount until it gets stable (initial balance/breakeven)
	or if balance had a growth and reached to a specific level use higher risk (max 1%) until it remains higher than initial balance

6. adjust your risk based on high/low probability trades also keep it below the maximum risk
   use lower risks for lower probability trades when your in heavy drawdown
   
7. after each refinement in your profitable edge , like before start with lower risk levels and raise it gradually after getting comfortable with new tweaks and results
