valid swing pullback potential properties:
1. retraces atleast 50% of the current wave movement (discount/premium zone)	
	otherwise it will not treated as a valid pullback within the swing and it will be considered as internal structure pullback
	
2. three candles with opposite color of the trend close below/above each other
	candle number 1 = first candle with opposite color of the trend which can be the candle that causes lowest or highest point or first candle that came after this candle
	candle number 2 = first candle with opposite color of the trend that closes below/above of candle number 1
	candle number 3 = candle with opposite color of the trend that closes below/above/above of candle number 2
	
	
	ideas:
	1. after creating new low/high if 3 candle rule submited any new lowest/highest low/high which is not closed and only wick, it will be actual low/high for BOS/CHOCH
	
	
** we can combine properties to filter out invalid pullbacks
