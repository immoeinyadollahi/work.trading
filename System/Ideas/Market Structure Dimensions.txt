Types Of Market Structure:
1. Swing			->	Narrative
2. Internal		->	Fullfills Swing Structure Objectives
3. Fractal			->	Fullfills Internal Structure Objectives




Swing 		-> CHOCH 		-> new swing trend
Internal 	-> CHOCH 		-> signals start or end of Swing pullback
Fractal		-> CHOCH		-> signals start or end of Internal pullback



Structure Within Swing Trading Range = Internal Structure
Structure Within Internal Trading Range = Fractal Structure




recommended timeframes for these types:
H4 -> Swing
M15 -> Internal
M1 -> Fractal

** timeframes for each type of structure can change in different situations and switched to other
** CHOCH in Internal & Fractal timeframes may be signaled with delay or failure or even not happen at all and their objective structures may already started or ended their pullback
	so we should switch timeframes for more reactive changes
