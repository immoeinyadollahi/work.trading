Mechanical System:
Create A Mechanical Rule-Based System With Edge Over The Market (Profitable System)
System Includes Phases Such As:
1. Technical Concepts
2. 


** Each Phase Parts Should Have Rules That Is Already Tested And Worked
** Phases After Passing Experimental Process Determine Whether Or Not The System (Edge) Is Actually Working And Ensures Profitability In Long-Term Process
** If The System Proven To Deliver Profitability In Long-Term It Can Be Tweaked And Refined Later To Bring Maximum Outcome 
** Only After Successful Experimental Process We Use The System In Live Market
