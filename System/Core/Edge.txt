Mechanical System:
Create A Mechanical Rule-Based And Repeatable System With Edge Over The Market (Backtested,Proven,Profitable System)
System Includes Phases Such As:
1. Technical Concepts
2. 


** Each Phase Parts Should Have Rules That Is Already Tested And Worked
** Phases After Passing Experimental Process Determine Whether Or Not The System (Edge) Is Actually Working And Ensures Profitability In Long-Term Process
** If The System Proven To Deliver Profitability In Long-Term It Can Be Tweaked And Refined Later To Bring Maximum Outcome 
** Only After Successful Experimental Process We Use The System In Live Market 



Consistency:
All System Phases And Their Rules And Process Must Be Hardcoded And Fixed
For Consistency We Should Repeat The Process Exactly The Same In Each Trading Day
Like A Mechanical Robot All System Process Must Executed Identicaly In Daily Basis
