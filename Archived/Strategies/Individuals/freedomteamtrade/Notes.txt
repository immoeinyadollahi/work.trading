3 phase system

1. using back-tested,proven and rule-based strategy that works	(edge or long term positive result)
	a repeatable system which can be used in everyday trading

2. automation	(limit orders for entry,take profit,stop loss)
	will fix discipline problems to follow strategy (solve emotions and psychology concerns)
	will fix risk management
	
	process:
		1. go to watchlist and find trading setups based on proven strategy (edge)
		2. set automation orders (enter,tp,sl) 
		3. walk away and let strategy do the work

3. scaling
	grow small account to large one with consistency
